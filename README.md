A bundle of small games done in Haskell, offered via a game server of sorts

At the moment there are two games: Tic-tac-to and Rock-paper-scissor. Each game needs two players to
start and others can join to watch a game in progress.

Players can create a game (which will create a room) or join a game (room). The second player that jois a game (room) causes the game to start and whoever joins later is watching the game
